Extracting data from json using Python.

# Where to get the raw json
This I wont say as it keeps it secret and this code is worthless without the data in the first place.
It stops script kiddies trying to show of something they didn't make and have no clue how it works.

# How to use it
Name the json data as data.txt and have it in the same folder as the python script.
main.py is the main script and will extract the answers for each question and output them to a file with the same name as the assessment it came from.
dataextractor.py is used for testing and will get more info such as the amount of marks.
Thats all there is to this.
